# HTML and CSS capstone project - [gatherings].

>  This is a solo projects at the end of the of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum of the HTML and CSS section. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications to improve and test the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program. The main objective was to desing a The Directory of Schools Webpage inspired by Mathew Njuguna and others on behance, with a different theme. I choose to create a website named [gatherings] where people can meet in real life (after the COVID-19 situation) creating and sharing events in the region desired.
